        Designed to be the pre-eminent monument of the Acropolis, 
        the Parthenon epitomises the glory of Ancient Greece. 
        Meaning 'virgin's apartment', it's dedicated to Athena 
        Parthenos, the goddess embodying the power and prestige 
        of the city. The largest Doric temple ever completed in 
        Greece, the Parthenon took 15 years to build.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">The Acropolis is the most important ancient site in 
        the Western world. Crowned by the Parthenon, it
         stands sentinel over Athens, visible from almost
          everywhere within the city. Its monuments and 
          sanctuaries of white Pentelic marble gleam in 
          the midday sun and gradually take on a honey hue
           as the sun sinks, while at night they stand
            brilliantly illuminated above the city. 
            A glimpse of this magnificent sight cannot 
            fail to exalt your spirit.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">After all the buildings on the Acropolis were reduced 
        to ashes by the Persians on the eve of the Battle of
         Salamis (480 BC), Pericles set about his ambitious
          rebuilding program. He transformed the Acropolis
           into a city of temples, which has come to be 
           regarded as the zenith of Classical Greece.</p>
    
    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">The Acropolis of the fifth century BC is the most 
        accurate reflection of the splendour, power and 
        wealth of Athens at its greatest peak, the golden 
        age of Perikles. In the mid-fifth century BC, when 
        the Acropolis became the seat of the Athenian 
        League and Athens was the greatest cultural centre 
        of its time, Perikles initiated an ambitious building
        project which lasted the entire second half of the
        fifth century BC. Designed to be the pre-eminent 
        monument of the Acropolis, the Parthenon epitomises 
        the glory of Ancient Greece. Meaning 'virgin's apartment',
        it's dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the goddess embodying 
        the power and prestige of the city. The largest Doric 
        temple ever completed in Greece, the Parthenon took 
        15 years to build. Athenians and foreigners alike
        worked on this project, receiving a salary of one
        drachma a day. The most important buildings 
        visible on the Acropolis today - that is, the
        Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and 
        the Temple of Athena Nike, were erected during 
        this period under the supervision of the 
        greatest architects, sculptors and artists of 
        their time.</p>
