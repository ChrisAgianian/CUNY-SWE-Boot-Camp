    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced [sandoˈrini]),
        officially Thira, is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, 
        about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from the Greek mainland. 
        It is the largest island of a small circular archipelago, 
        which bears the same name and is the remnant of a caldera. 
        It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, 
        with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census 
        population of 15,550.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in 
        recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption),
         which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan 
         civilization.The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by 
         volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep.</p>
    
    <p style="font-family: Corsiva;">Santorini is considered to be the most sought after place for a romantic 
        getaway in Greece, since there are not many places in the world where you
         can enjoy exquisitely clear waters while perched on the rim of a massive 
         active volcano in the middle of the sea! The island has a growing 
         reputation as a “wedding destination” for couples not only from Greece
          but from all over the world. A trip to Santorini with the other half is 
          a dream for anyone who has seen at least one photo of the island's 
          famous Caldera and exchanging kisses beneath Santorini's famous 
          sunset is the ultimate romantic experience!</p>
